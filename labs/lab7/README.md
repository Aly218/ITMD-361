Lab 7 for ITMD 361:
I used an index.html file as reference which was provided by the Professor. Then, I added a basic event handler to the page so that when the button is clicked the browser alerts the contents of the form input control added to your name. Ir also changes the contents of the headline below the button to contain the contents of the form input control.
